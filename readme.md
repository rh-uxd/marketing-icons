# Red Hat Marketing Icon Library
The Red Hat Marketing Icon Library provides Red Hat marketing icons from the Brand team in a [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) library. It makes it easier for Sketch users to browse and use the marketing icons in their designs.

### The icon library includes:

* Sketch symbols for all of the latest marketing icons.
* Harveyball loading icons 0-100 percentage.
* Social media icons

## Downloading the Library
* Browse to the [Sketch cloud library page](https://www.sketch.com/s/bf415b2d-f138-445a-aa94-3f6ec20d3857)
* Click on the *Add library to Sketch* button ![Add library button](images/Sketch--add-library-button.png)

## Updating the library when new changes are available
Sketch will automatically receive library updates in the top, right corner of an open Sketch file. You'll want to update the Marketing Icon library **and** update the symbols within your file (two separate notifications). You'll have to update **all** files that are using the icon symbols - it is not a one and done process, unfortunately.

## Using the Library
Please review the [brand guidelines](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hWN_blHI16nvj8ZoOF9E34d40rgpjeiWjNgZ4TB8JzY/edit) for icons. For more information about the brand assets and guidelines, visit the [Brand Mojo page](https://mojo.redhat.com/groups/brand-communities).

### Colors:
* Please use monochromatic colors for social media icons to comply with brand guidelines for those companies. Full color icons may be used in certain cases but monochromatic is the safe way to go.
* Four colors are available for marketing notifications.
  * Red Hat red
  * PatternFly blue
  * White
  * Black

### Contributing a new icon or updating icons to the library
Follow these steps:

1. Download the library file from here: https://www.sketch.com/s/bf415b2d-f138-445a-aa94-3f6ec20d3857
2. Add the new icon to the appropriate artboard or create a new artboard according to how it is organized by the brand team.
3. Make certain the icon fits into the 60 x 40 px grid nicely with the other icons.
4. When naming a new symbol, follow the naming mechanism within that same category (ex. 01_Hardware / Tablet / Tablet_outline)
5. Apply the layer style for colors to the icon
6. Make it clear which page in the file you edited and which symbols on the page you added/edited by adding a ⭐️ or some other mark to call them out.
7. Zip your file and attach it to the Github issue you were assigned to. Add a list of the symbols you added/edited. And finally, tag @awatkins-rh in your comment.
